# Personal Website & Resume

This repository contains my personal website and resume, forked from [pforpallav.github.io](https://github.com/pforpallav/pforpallav.github.io). The original template was created by Kumar Pallav.

## Overview
This website serves as my personal portfolio and online resume. It's built using:
- HTML/CSS for the website structure
- JSON for content management

## Features
- Clean, minimalist design

## Content Structure
The website content is managed through JSON files in the `_data` directory:

- `edu.json` - Education details
- `proj.json` - Projects and volunteering
- `skill.json` - Skills and competencies
- `aboutme.json` - Intro
